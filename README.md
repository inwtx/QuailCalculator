<br><br>
This calculator sets up the dates to run a continuous quail meat production schedule.<br>
The schedule is dependent upon the length of the brooder period, from 2, 3, or 4 weeks.<br>
The calculator date schedules allows for the continuous scheduling of 56 day incubator<br>
to culling bird cycles, while preventing any overlap of incubator, brooder, and grow-out <br>
usage.<br>
1. Right click on the Collect eggs column to select the period during which you intend<br>
    to collect eggs from a quail layer pen.  This column setup is not required.<br>
2. Select the incubation start date by clicking on the small icon next to the blue box.<br>
3. When any date in the date row boxes is the same as the current date, the dates in <br>
    the date row boxes will be circled in red, indicating it is time to perform that action.<br>
    Dates are circled in yellow on day prior to actual (red) dates.<br>
4. When the '1st incubation:' top row 'Process date' is circled, all the dates in the top<br>
    row have been processed and the '2nd incubation:' 'incubation start' date needs to<br>
    be moved up to the top '1st incubation:' row.  This can be done by clicking on the <br>
    incubation start date icon and selecting the '2nd incubation:' 'incubation start' date<br>
    or by clicking on the up arrow button that should have appeared at the bottom left <br>
    of the program interface.<br><br>
See the Libre Office file 'Quail culling cycle.ods' in the program folder for a visual<br>
outline of the calculations in this program.<br><br>
